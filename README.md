Sino-Korean Phonology

Analysing linguistic structures of Sino-Korean vocabulary with Hanja, Chinese, and Cantonese. 
1. Phonological comparisons between the Korean pronunciation of Hanja single characters with modern Chinese (Mandarin), incorporating standard distinctive phonological features and IPA to infer patterns of sound conversion. 

TBC:

2. Network construction of bi-/tri-character Hanja phrases in Korean using tags on word length, position/order, frequency of usage. 

3. Apply phylogenetic analyses in comparative linguistics to aligned word-list data obtained from Middle Chinese, Middle Korean, and modern forms. Create a substitution model matrix to phonemes, with potential expansion to account for phonological place features & coarticulative changes.
